<joe9> letoram: got it, I was missing the resize.
<joe9> letoram: Thanks for the suggestion.  [09:29]
<letoram> so you have buffers flying around and GL working? :)
<joe9> letoram: funny, I have the basic template working. It should get easier from here (optimism!!)  [09:34]
<letoram> well, it's GL.. easy is not really the state of things :)  [09:35]
<joe9> btw, quick question, I noticed a call to    if ((status = arcan_shmifext_headless_setup(arcan_shmif_primary(SHMIF_INPUT),..) whereas I followed this function (from
       reading the code):    struct arcan_shmif_cont arcanShmifControl = arcan_shmif_open(SEGID_APPLICATION, SHMIF_ACQUIRE_FATALFAIL, &shmarguments); just want to check if you
       have any recommendations ?  [09:36]
<joe9> would you recommend arcan_shmif_primary(SHMIF_INPUT) or arcan_shmif_open(SEGID_APPLICATION, SHMIF_ACQUIRE_FATALFAIL, &shmarguments) to build the arcan_shmif_cont  [09:37]
<letoram> primary is a different beast altogether  [09:38]
<letoram> it comes into play when I write backends for things like SDL, Qemu etc. where the codebase has a separation between audio and video (or possibly multi-windows)  [09:39]
<letoram> it is just an accessor method to a static shmif_cont (the "primary" connection, kill that and any subwindows die)
<joe9> letoram: oh, ok. Thanks. I should just stick with using SEGID_APPLICATION... stuff  [09:40]
<letoram> you have quite a few different SEGID_ to chose from though (although not that many make a difference, it is up to the DE scripts)
<letoram> SEGID_GAME, SEGID_VM, SEGID_TUI, ...  [09:41]
<letoram> the backend thing is almost always the pattern "have shared setup routine that is called from both audio and video init. setup checks if primary- is set, if not, it
          makes the shmif_open connection and then sets this as primary.. alloc a struct that maps whatever state I'm writing a backend for needs and set that as the (void*) tag
          to the primary connection  [09:42]
<joe9> for this particular app, I think SEGID_WIDGET would be good.  [09:43]
<letoram> durden will (very soon) route SEGID_WIDGET to the global menu window :)
                                                                                [09:45]
<joe9> oh, ok. So, I am better off with SEGID_APPLICATION.  I do not want the window
       to handle much input (keyboard/mouse). It is more of a realtime chart app.
                                                                                [09:48]
<letoram> you can just discard them, but remember to poll-flush the event-queue so
          arcan doesn't thing you're not responding  [09:52]
<joe9> letoram: yes, I have to get to how to do input poll/wait/flush. any C samples
       that can guide me, please? I have seen docs/samples using lua
       scripts/applications.  [09:54]
<letoram> rather trivial:
          https://github.com/letoram/arcan/blob/master/tests/frameservers/counter/counter.c
                                                                                [09:56]
<letoram>
          https://github.com/letoram/arcan/blob/master/src/shmif/arcan_shmif_event.h#L195
          closest to documentation there is  [09:57]
