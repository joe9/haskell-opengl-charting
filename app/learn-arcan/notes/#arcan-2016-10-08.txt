<joe9> letoram: I am logging in through the tty, and doing this to start arcan: "cd /home/j/dev/apps/durden-arcan/arcan/build && ./arcan -p /home/j/etc/arcan/appl
       /home/j/dev/apps/durden-arcan/durden/durden""  [04:40]
<joe9> I notice that the terminals I open up using m1_return do not source /etc/profile
<joe9> just want to check if this is expected behaviour.  [04:41]
<joe9> When mapping keys on durden startup, the last prompt is "Press and hold the desired combination: ESCAPE to cancel" -- What is this desired combination for? I tried a few
       Ctrl - Alt - BackSpace and Ctrl -Alt - Delete, but, the message prompt remained  [04:43]
<letoram> hmm, good question :D
<letoram> havn't done that one in a while ..
<joe9> After logging into the tty and before starting arcan, I am doing "sudo chmod ugo+rwx /dev/dri/card0", but, still I get the "platform/egl-dri(), couldn't get drmMaster
       (Permission denied), trying  to continue anyways."  [04:44]
<letoram> drmMaster is a facepalm part of drm,
<joe9> below is the log when I start arcan using the command: " ./arcan -p /home/j/etc/arcan/appl /home/j/dev/apps/durden-arcan/durden/durden 2>&1 | tee --append
       durden-start.messages" https://gist.github.com/c99d7a53f3985fc15a014040a3fcb03d  [04:45]
<letoram> you actually need some root only capability to open the card as drm master
<joe9> letoram: can I do setuid on the arcan exe?
<joe9> letoram: would that help?
<letoram> it might, here I can continue without drmMaster (there are some sideeffects)
<joe9> this is the command I used previously -- sudo chown root:users build/arcan && sudo chmod a+s build/arcan  [04:46]
<letoram> what gpu are you using?  [04:47]
<joe9> letoram: so, just stick with what I am doing now: "sudo chmod ugo+rwx /dev/dri/card0" and start arcan
<joe9> letoram: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/erKUuT65UMY2bZ3esWAO/
<letoram> yeah, hopefully drmMaster thing will change with the whole render-noes thing, else I'll have to add support for the whole "separate launcher opens, gets privileges,
          drops, launches arcan, hands over descriptors..."  [04:48]
<letoram> but "arcan reported no available translation capable device" is the first big deal
<joe9> letoram: do not worry about it.  [04:49]
<joe9> letoram: I think I fixed that. I added the user to the group input
<letoram> yeah, that's the right fix
<joe9> letoram: I have the keyboard working.
<letoram> don't have my posix spec. available, but I thought it was shell that should source etc/profile and not the pty- setup, hmm  [04:50]
<joe9> "/etc/profile is invoked only for login shells because that is its specific purpose." -- could that be the issue? I am not using a login shell. I am logging in to the tty
       and then starting arcan.  [04:52]
<letoram> indeed  [04:53]
<joe9> letoram: font is ok. emacs --no-window started fine in the terminal. are there any better fonts out there? I can use the current default. But, just want to check if there
       is a better option.  [04:54]
<letoram> probably :)  [04:55]
<letoram> you can just add to durden/fonts
<letoram> and then global/config/terminal/font to switch
<letoram> thoough I might have messed that one up, fix on the laptop but not pushed yet  [04:56]
<joe9> letoram: ok, Thanks. I can pull the durden repo later  [04:58]
-arcanbot- [durden] letoram pushed 2 new commits to master: https://git.io/vP42m
-arcanbot- durden/master f2ec59e bjornstahl: extcon relaunch now tracks path used
-arcanbot- durden/master abc5889 bjornstahl: fix dynamic terminal font switch (tools/pulldown break)
<joe9> letoram: regarding changing the keymap, what would you recommend? I use dvorak and I like your approach of ditching xkb backward compatibility. With X, I just use the
       default keyboard layout in the tty's and switch to dvorak+sticky keys through .xinitrc. I read that I can use the conv tool to generate the symtable.lua file  [05:05]
<letoram> the conv tool "tries" to use the linux keyboard format but it does a pretty bad job   [05:06]
<letoram> I got scared, very scared, after reading up on how that works on linux..
<joe9> letoram: I can create my own keymap by hand. I have the keycodes and keysym tables.
<letoram> global/input/keyboard/- bind utf-8 / bind keysym / save  [05:07]
<letoram> should appear in devmaps/keyboard  [05:08]
<letoram> you can patch the lua file raw there
<joe9> on wayland, I use this    egl_display = eglGetDisplay((EGLNativeDisplayType) display); to get the eglDisplay. Any suggestions on what the command would be from arcan,
       please?  [05:12]
<joe9> letoram: this is my sample .c file that I used on wayland to build a simple opengl render client https://gist.github.com/1d7b20e517fd915e2d80561dfef76f65
<letoram> didn't I cover that in the pastebin? ref: arcan_shmif_interop.h   [05:15]
<letoram> you can also see http://github.com/letoram/SDL2/blob/master/src/video/arcan/SDL_arcanopengl.c  [05:16]
<joe9> letoram: yes, Thanks. sorry for the bother.
-arcanbot- [durden] letoram pushed 5 new commits to master: https://git.io/vP42d  [05:18]
-arcanbot- durden/master 240ffc6 bjornstahl: run_display_action extended
-arcanbot- durden/master 8e95e1e bjornstahl: lbar crash on bad step/hint
-arcanbot- durden/master 565a6d4 bjornstahl: don't print- whitelist eval status
<joe9> letoram: to switch monitors, should I go through the global monitor? I have 1 gpu with 2 monitors that arcan is starting up on (card0)?  [05:19]
<joe9> s/global monitor/global config/  [05:20]
<letoram> there's a cycle display, let me check the path  [05:23]
<letoram> global/display/cycle active
<joe9> thanks a lot.
<joe9> letoram: on a different note, do you have any qemu creation scripts that you do not mind sharing for the browser, etc.? Which browser do you use or recommend for arcan?
       Do you use durden as your primary work space?  [05:26]
<letoram> my web use can be managed by lynx really :)  [05:31]
<letoram> the rest is scripts for scraping forums, ...  [05:32]
<letoram> but I usually have a win/linux VM running via QEmu for other tools
<letoram> qemu will be godlike as soon as they figure out guest-GPU scanout buffer sharing though ..  [05:33]
<letoram> but I'm usually just (modprobe kms; chown /dev/kms to me; qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 4096 -smp 4 -display arcan -netdev user,id=mynet0,smb=/home/me/shared
          -cdrom if/i/need/install/iso -cpu host vmimage.qcow  [05:35]
<letoram> there's something more needed (usbdevice to tablet or something) but I don't have it at hand right now  [05:36]
<letoram> hmm, should really sync/finish the qemu backend for audio/multidisplay/virgil.. free sat/sun/mon so a decent sized project..  [05:46]
<joe9> ok, Thanks.  [06:11]
<joe9> letoram: https://gist.github.com/f91316d9e3a418ae81b529dcdca4c3b0 I got this
       far and started learning about the FBO and realize that it would be software
       rendering. In my case, I render directly to the gpu using the glbindbuffer,
       gldraw, etc. I do not write anything to the cpu buffer so that got me thinking
       if I even need the "arcan shared memory context". I am not sure if I need the
       "shared memory context" to transfer the data to the  [08:43]
<joe9> gpu buffer (glBufferData). Any thoughts, please?
<letoram> think of it as the Display in X  [08:44]
<letoram> but you need to explicitly synch, that is the arcan_shmif_signal or for GL,
          arcan_shmif_signalhandle  [08:45]
<letoram> https://speakerdeck.com/letoram/arcan-design slide 15 or so +
          https://github.com/letoram/arcan/wiki/Shmif  [08:49]
<joe9> if you do not mind me asking, why do I need "explicit synch"? I would be doing
       glFlush. In glut, there is "glutSwapBuffers() and glutPostRedisplay()". Is the
       "explicit sync" similar to that? I will check out the slide. Thanks.
<letoram> the sync is between arcan and the connected client,  [08:50]
<letoram> when glFlush finishes it updates the contents of your display, rendertarget
          etc. 
<joe9> oh, ok.  [08:51]
<letoram> but arcan doesn't know what you want to display - that's the signalhandle
          thing
<letoram> but in your case, you want arcan_shmifext_eglsignal (what actually happens:
          https://github.com/letoram/arcan/blob/master/src/shmif/egl-dri-rnode/egl-dri-rnode.c:#L272
          )  [08:53]
<joe9> letoram: ok, Thanks.  [08:54]
<joe9> letoram: I think I got it. FBO is just the frame buffer object (vertext buffer data) etc. How does arcan know which window this stuff should be displayed on?  [09:15]
<joe9> letoram: do not worry about it.
<joe9> letoram: I need to read up more on FBO's. I think they are not the same as the vertex buffer data. They seem to be a superset of that. Maybe, I specify the window details
       while creating/initializing the FBO.  [09:16]
<letoram> the 10s explanation:  [09:25]
<letoram> an FBO is an abstract container that can hold a color, depth, and stencil buffer (but you don't need all three)  [09:26]
<letoram> you can only have one FBO active at a time in a GL context and it is expensive to switch between them
<letoram> the draw commands you submit, output to the active FBO and if there's no active FBO, the Display etc.  [09:27]
<letoram> this is used for a ton of effects, everything from shadow mapping to glows to blurs  [09:28]
<letoram> see the boilerplate in https://github.com/letoram/SDL2/blob/master/src/video/arcan/SDL_arcanopengl.c#L104  [09:29]
<joe9> letoram: Thanks. sorry for the bother. I think I understand the Frame Buffer. Where is the window actually created? when I do shmif_open?  [09:34]
<letoram> in shmif_open
<joe9> got it. Thanks a lot.  [09:35]
