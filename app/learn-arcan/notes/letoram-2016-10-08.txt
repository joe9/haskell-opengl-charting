<joe9> letoram: Thanks a lot for the detailed comment.  [02:19]
<joe9> my workflow involves using terimnal + emacs + firefox. I think terminal comes
       with arcan/durden. emacs can run with --no-window, so it is fine. and, I can
       use qemu to run firefox, correct?  [02:20]
<letoram> correct,  [02:27]
<letoram> but there's a but :)  [02:28]
<joe9> what is the "but"?  [02:29]
<joe9> "patched qemu"?  [02:30]
<letoram> 1. you'll fight a bit getting the keymap you want (I don't have a conversion
          from say xkb-), 2. no sound in the qemu backend yet (though that can of
          course still map to alsa etc.)
<letoram>  and patched qemu of course :)
<joe9> I was trying to figure out the keyboard stuff as my keymap is different
       https://github.com/joe9/skb/blob/master/src/Keymap/CustomDvorak.hs  [02:32]
<joe9> Thanks. will try to boot into durden before tackling it.
<letoram> you can always remap inside durden, I've used it with a guitar hero
          controller :)
<joe9> I do not care for sound, so, not an issue for me.  [02:33]
*** durden: Unknown command
<joe9> ok, Thansk.  [02:34]
<joe9> Thanks
<letoram> no problem, and good luck :)  [02:35]
