<joe9> letoram: one thing that is proving to be a pita is the switching back and forth between arcan and X. I could not get arcan working on X with the sdl backend. I think you
       mentioned using sdl1.2. I could only find an sdl backend.  [12:27]
<letoram> the sdl backend is sdl1.2
<letoram> arcan "should" be able to run on a VT and switch like normal, but it doesn't
<letoram> it's a bug I'm working on when I feel too happy :p  [12:28]
<letoram> but the whole VT switching thing is such a legacy pile of bugs and hacks
<joe9> Should the sdl backend version work on X? ./arcan -p /home/j/etc/arcan/appl /home/j/dev/apps/durden-arcan/durden/durden is my command. I get a big window spanning the
       whole of the first monitor most of the second monitor. I could not open a terminal within that window.
<letoram> which means you just send a kill SIGUSR1 to the server and you just messed up its internal state machine, had it sacrifice the exclusive lock on the GPU and now you
          can grab it and steal its buffers then give everything back ..  [12:30]
<joe9> when I run my app that tries to connect to durden/arcan from another X terminal, it cannot get a connection
<letoram> ls
<letoram> heh, wrong window there :)
<letoram> try setting explicit dimensions, arcan -w 800 -h 400 or something
<joe9> oh, cool. Thanks. good idea.
<letoram> cruft is that SDL gets the dimension of the screen and no idea about the decorations  [12:31]
<letoram> so fullscreen + decorations means not everything is showing :p
<letoram> you have to explicitly set the connection path
<letoram> just like DISPLAY=:0 in X
<letoram> arcan uses ARCAN_CONNPATH=<appl-defined> usually durden for well, durden but that can be configured  [12:32]
<joe9> letoram: cool. got the small durden window open. let me try with the CONNPATH. Thanks. That is such a relief.  [12:33]
<letoram> that's how I develop on OSX :)
<joe9> letoram: I get this error https://paste.pound-python.org/show/i67yOMXaLVOy2vMQpckr/ when I try to link with the sdl build version of the libraries  [12:39]
<joe9> letoram: I presume that is because you did not need that function for the sdl backend
<joe9> letoram: any recommendations on how I can fake that function when using the sdl backend
<letoram> ah that's the caveat I mentioned a while back -
<letoram> handle passing does not exist when running in X  [12:40]
<joe9> oh, ok.
<joe9> just use the bare signal correct?
<letoram> that's where the alternative "glReadPixels" or "glGetTexImage2D" hack into vidp- with bare signal works
<joe9> ok, got it. Thanks.
<letoram> but it's still a bug that those functions aren't stubbed  [12:46]
<joe9> I prefer this instead of silently failing.  [12:48]
<letoram> well, not being able to extract a handle is always a possible failure mode  [12:49]
<letoram> say you are connected to a rendernode assigned to GPU2, arcan runs only using GPU1 and gets a handle, tries to map it, then the driver tries to negotiate so called
          PRIME buffers which rely on a scarce resource, that resource isn't available - bam, no handle passing  [12:50]
<letoram> unpredictable runtime failure
<letoram> I think durden has help for testing that, target/video/advanced/disable buffer passing
<letoram> then the display server explicitly says for this target that no, I won't accept GPU buffers from you
<joe9> cool, got it working on X. That is such a relief.  [12:53]
<joe9> How do you structure your build files (make, etc.) when building for osx and durden-only?  [12:54]
<letoram> durden is completely disassociated from arcan build etc. wise,
<letoram> for OSX it's just like with SDL on X,  [12:55]
<letoram> i.e. cmake -DVIDEO_PLATFORM=sdl ../src and it figures out the rest
<joe9> letoram: I am not talking about durde or arcan build
<joe9> letoram:  I am talking about any client apps that you might be writing. such as what I am doing. a standalone app.
<joe9> for example, I have different LDFLAGS for the different backends  [12:56]
<letoram> I just let the shmif- dependency pull the rest in
<letoram> but most "standalone" work for me is writing backends for other projects, so there's infrastructure to latch on to  [12:57]
<letoram> arcan install should come with the normal pkgtool stuff
<letoram> btw. if you want to test your external app without something as big as durden running,  [13:00]
<joe9> ok, will just reuse the -DVIDEO_PLATFORM=sdl as preprocessor directive in my code
<letoram> http://pastebin.com/fLrpgJfK  [13:04]
<letoram> that's pretty much the minimum to recuringly accept a connection with the ARCAN_CONNPATH=demo  [13:05]
<letoram> so save as demo.lua in a folder called demo, arcan /path/to/demo and it should work :)
<joe9> cool, will try that. That is so cool. Thanks a lot.
